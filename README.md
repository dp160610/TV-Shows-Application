# TV Show Search Application 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This React application allows users to view TV show schedules. By default, the app loads today's shows into the UI. Users have the following options:

1. **Search:** Users can enter a search term and click the search button. The UI will update to display filtered results based on the search term.

2. **Get Full Schedule by Date:** Users can enter a date in the 'YYYY-MM-DD' format and click the "Get Full Schedule" button. The app will display TV shows scheduled for the specified date.

3. **Get Full Schedule (All Shows):** If the user clicks the "Get Full Schedule" button with an empty input field, the app will retrieve and display all TV shows from the API [https://api.tvmaze.com/schedule](https://api.tvmaze.com/schedule).

The application also includes validation checks to ensure the correctness of user inputs.
